    "**PassengerId:** doesn't bring any information as the Id is certainly randomly given or in order of registration. Actually the registration order may give some information such as socio-economic status or status if tickets were sold to people with higher status first. In our case we have other varaibles that gives the same information and we don't know if our assumption holds. So we will most likely not use the Id in our model\n",

    "**Survived:** It is the predicted variable.\n",

    "**Pclass:** Categorical feature that we will most likely use. Chances that it correlates with **Fare** is high but we will see that the later will most likely be transformed. Some passengers paid a higher fare than others while being in a lower class. That is because the fare is the price paid for one purchase, meaning that 5 people from the second class may in total pay more than 2 person in 1st class but that doesn't mean they are richer or that their ticket is worth more. That is why we will transform ths variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name:** This variable is useless as it is but using titles in people names and create categories may be helpful. Titles are a sign of wealth and status and will probably correlate with Pclass and Fare (transformed).\n",

    "**Sex:** Obvious with the save woman and children first policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age:** Same reason as above. Also we have a lot of missing values and some outliers. We could just drop those rows but they account for nearly 1/5 of our dataset. So we decide to use the encyclopedia where after some research people were able to find the age of some of those persons. We will certainly webscrape to retrieve the ages.\n",

So the reason why survival rate went up for older women is actually linked to the fact that they are mainly in 1st class. For men it should be the same but it looks like women and children first policy's effect comes before the effect of classes. It can make sense as the advantage of being in best classes is linked to the deck your cabin is in and that being in the best location only gives an advantage at the start of the incident (people going from their location to the rescue boats) but after that and thus for men, the physical abilities matters more.\n",
